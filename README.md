# Face Recognition and Verification

This project implements a face recognition and verification system using deep learning.
It is designed to determine whether two given face images belong to the same person. 
The system utilizes a convolutional neural network trained to generate embeddings, which are then used to compute similarity scores between pairs of faces. 
This project can be used for various applications, including identity verification, access control, and security systems.
